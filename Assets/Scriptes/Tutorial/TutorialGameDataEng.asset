  _messages:
  - "Now I\u2019ll show you how to play."
  - I wanted to make a step-by-step tutorial with cute animation, but why bother?
    Try to experiment!
  - Balls appear at the top line. They fall into the receiver and disappear. The
    longer the ball is falling, the more points you get.  Slow down the ball!
  - To do this, press SHOP to access three sections
  - "PHYSICAL OBJECTS section contains elements that block the ball\u2019s way"
  - ACTIVE OBJECTS section contains ball boosters that can slow it down, accelerate
    etc.
  - "In SPAWNS AND BOOSTERS section you can:\r\n- select another ball spawning point
    (the more the better)\r"
  - "-reduce ball generation time by 0,04sec. I know it\u2019s not much, but I don\u2019t
    want you to finish the game too quickly!"
  - '- increases scoring speed. Very useful. Use it more often'
  - EXIT button does exactly what it should. Exits to the main menu!
  - "Place some objects and observe how they affect the game. I hope you\u2019ll
    enjoy the game and the process will calm you dawn."
  - "Don\u2019t forget, you can delete all your saves anytime and start over."
