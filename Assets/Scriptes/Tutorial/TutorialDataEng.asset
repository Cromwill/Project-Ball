  - Welcome to Project Ball!
  - Let me show you how to play (if you have a dog, pet it first)
  - There is a navigation bar at the top of your screen
  - The CLEAN SAVE button erases all saves and starts a new game
  - "The second button doesn\u2019t work because I wasn\u2019t payed for it"
  - The third button shows you ads. After watching an ad you get points equal to
    15 mins of playing time (you can pet your dog while waiting)
  - Now look at the bottom bar. TOTAL shows your total points from all levels. You
    can use them to buy playing fields.
  - "Now, after petting your dog one more time, let\u2019s start the first level!"
  - Press BUY and select the level.
